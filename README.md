# Lab-Session-9

# Introduction

Master's in Information System is one of the growing fields and the demand for MSIS graduates have been increasing every year as Big Data and Analytics are the most sought after skills. Few years back there were only a handful of universities that offer MS in Information systems but with the increasing demand, more and more universities have incorporated the masters degree in Data Analytics. Santa Clara University is one of the top universities in the heart of silicon valley that offers Master's in information System. Being located at Silicon valley, the university curriculum is tailored to meet the growing industrials demands.

From the graph, you can see that MSIS graduates have skillset that matches 100% with the industrial needed skill set for the job profile "Data Analyst". The skillset for MSIS graduates matches more than 80% to the skillset required for other job profiles in the field of information systems.

# Description


#### Why I use this visualization? 

<img width="534" alt="screen shot 2017-11-18 at 11 57 50 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32216143/32984323-372249c6-cc59-11e7-94a7-88fd4b6f7054.png">

The table shows that SCU grads are hired by all major tech companies. The table has been sorted in descending order. Bigger the size of the square box indicates that higher is the rate of intake of SCU grads in those companies.

Skills such as Excel, SQL, Java, R, Apache Spark are the skillset that a candidate should possess in the field of analytics. SCU grads are skilled with those skills. The tree map indicates the number of SCU grads having these skillset.

This is a bar graph to represent the number of candidates in different job profile. I have used bar graph because it is easy to compare. It can easily be interpreted that more than 1000 SCU grads works in the field of business development. 

Business Developement skills involves both technical and mangerial skills. Hence, this explicitly shows that SCU grads have been skilled in both the fields. 

## How I improved from previous lab session 

This is the link to the previous version of cognitive walk through:
https://public.tableau.com/profile/parvathivarma#!/vizhome/MSISDashboard_FinalVersion_Lab6/RankingDsh

## Advantage

The dashboard comes with instructions to navigate through pages

The dashboard gives in the student profile and their major skillset

## Disadvantage

The Dashboard takes up a lot of white space

The emphasis for the recruiter is not very clear in this version of dashboard

I myself found it difficult to navigate through as the pages took time to load one image. 

## Improved version (Redesign)

Link to the latest version: 
https://public.tableau.com/views/MSISDashboardLab9/Story1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes

This version emphasis more on what the recruiter is looking for. 

It showcases the SCU grads skillset along with their demand in the market. 

This is more pursuasive version for a recruiter.

Navigation is made easier as it is all added into one story. 

# Future Roadmap

I would like to add another graph with the curriculum and correlating it with the industrial skillset required. 

# Data Source

The data was taken from the shared drive of Dashboards and visualization class
